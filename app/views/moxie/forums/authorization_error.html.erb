  Setup Problem
  <p>You just tried to access a page that requires a user to be logged in. The controller had a before_filter :require_user. You need to add a require_user method to your application_controller.rb that does whatever checks necessary to determine that a user is logged in. You will also need a current_user helper method within application_controller.rb that returns the logged in user. The forum will not work correctly until you have both of these.</p>
